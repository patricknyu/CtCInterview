###Q:
Implement a jigsaw puzzle.  Design the data structures and explain an algorithm to solve the puzzle.  You can assume that you have a fitsWith method which, when passed two puzzle pieces, returns true if the two pieces belong together.

###A:
This is a difficult problem.  My general idea was to use a boolean n dimensional array to represent the board.  My implementation was simplistic, so I will use theirs.

They use the idea of absolute position along with relative position.  Absolute position refers to when we know exactly where our piece goes.  Relative positions is ues to know it is next to another piece.

This is a really tough problem.  I'll replicate most of the code.
