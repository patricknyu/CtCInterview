###Q:
Design the data structures for an online book system.

###A:
This is a pretty vague description of a book system.  With all other OOD questions, we must ensure we ask enough questions to properly understand what we are asked to accomplish.

I'm going to assume this is a reader system which similar to a kindle, but is on a computer.

I'm going to create a Book, Kindle, and Library class.
