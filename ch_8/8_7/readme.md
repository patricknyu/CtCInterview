###Q:
Explain how you would design a chat server.  In particular, provide details about the various background components, classes, and methods.  What would be the hardest problems to solve?

###A:
Well this is a extremely difficult solution.  I'm going to change pace and implement it in python.  This will be fun.

I will need a UserMaster class which controls all the core user actions.  Then I'll have a User class which will have user actions.  I'll also have a conversation, groupchat, privatechat, message, addRequest, UserStatus, UserStatusType, and RequestStatus.

I'll be very large.
