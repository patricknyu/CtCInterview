###Q:
Design a musical jukebox using object-oriented principles.

###A:
My initial thoughts are to make JukeBox and Song classes.

The JukeBox class would be the main class, which will have a array which holds all the songs.  Then there would be a play method which took in a string which described the song we wanted to play from the array, played it, and would consequently assign to a next song.  We would need a displayCurrentSong method as well.  We would need an AddToPlaylist method as well to add to a ArrayList of songs.

The Song class would have a song name, artist, year, and song length.  It would also have a play method where it would play the song.

I'll put in a rough outline.
