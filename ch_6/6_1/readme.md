Q: You have 20 bottles of pills, 19 bottles have exactly 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams.  Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle?  You can only use the scale once.

A:  Number the bottles 1-20, then you get 1 pill from bottle one, 2 pills from bottle two and so on.  Then you weigh these pills.  Since (n + 1)*n/2 where n = 20 is 210, we then take the weight, "w".  We will find (w-210)/.1  then we get a number which is the bottle number of the 1.1 gram pills.
