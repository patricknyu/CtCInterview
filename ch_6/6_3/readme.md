##Q:
You have a five-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).  How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?  Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

##A:
Fill up the 5 quart jug and pour it into the 3 quart jug.  Then pour out your 3 quart jug and pour whatever is left in the 5 quart jug into the 3 quart jug.  Then fill up the 5 quart jug and pour as much as you can into the 3 quart jug with 2 quarts inside.  Then you will have 4 quarts of water in your 5 quart jug.
