##Q:
There is an 8x8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.  You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares.  Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board?  Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

##A:
It's impossible.  An easy way to prove this is to notice that dominos will all take up 	two spaces and it will always be one white along with one black.  When we remove two pieces in the corners, they are the same color hence, we will have 30 of one color and 32 of another color.  Hence it is impossible to fill this board up.
