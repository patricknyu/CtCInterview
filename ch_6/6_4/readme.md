##Q:
A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color, but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?

##A:
Given that there are c blue eyed people on the island, it will take c days.  Because each blue eyed person will see c-1 blue eyed people meaning that after c-1 days and nobody has left the island, a blue eyed person knows that they also must be blue eyed and they all leave on the cth day.
